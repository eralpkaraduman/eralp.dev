Hello, world! This is a demo post for `gatsby-theme-blog`.

Delete me, and get writing!

```js {1,3-4}
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    "gatsby-theme-blog", // highlight-line
    "gatsby-theme-notes",
  ],
}
```

This is another paragraph after the code block.

## This is a secondary heading

```jsx
import React from "react"
import { ThemeProvider } from "theme-ui"
import theme from "./theme"

export default props => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>{props.children}</ThemeProvider>
)
```
