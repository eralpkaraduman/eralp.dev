Even though I make money by developing web apps, I don't like to use browsers much. If there's any possibility to use anything else than a web app, I'd like to try it. So I tried opening GitHub PR's without the website using GitHub's CLI. It is very nice, here are my favourite commands;

This one simply opens a draft PR with last commit as title.

```bash
gh pr create --fill --draft
``` 

And this one brings the URL of the PR

```bash
gh pr view
```
