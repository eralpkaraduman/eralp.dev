This first post is about this blog itself. Let me tell you about my blog engine :D.
Haha, yet another engineer talking about their blog engine.
I won't bore you with details but basically It's based on [Gatsby.js](http://gatsbyjs.com) and source
is at [github.com/eralpkaraduman/eralp.dev](https://github.com/eralpkaraduman/eralp.dev) if you are interested.
