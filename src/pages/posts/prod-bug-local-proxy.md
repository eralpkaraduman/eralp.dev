Say you have an app that reads json from an API, renders some UI. And you have a specific API endpoint that crashes the UI on production. This was exactly the case couple days ago in our project, there are several ways to fix this, and I chose to use a proxy to fix it on my local environment.

I saved the API response that crashes the UI to a file on my computer. Installed [Proxyman](https://proxyman.io) (other alternatives as [Charles](https://www.charlesproxy.com/) or [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org) are good too). Routed my browser traffic through the proxy. Setup a rule in proxy so that when I go to `localhost/api/aResourceThatWorksFine` it would capture it. Then, instead of asking my local api server, it would return the response I saved. The file contains the response from `production/api/theResourceThatCrashes`. The term for this kind of rule in [Proxyman](https://proxyman.io) is [Map Local](https://docs.proxyman.io/advanced-features/map-local). This way, I was able to investigate the issue with little hassle. Without for example moving the production database to my local environment.

Couple gotchas were that if your server sends a `Date` header. You need to remove it from the response you saved to the file proxy reads. Since it will be the same and behind every time proxy returns it, browsers donâ€™t like it. Other header you might need to change is `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`. Make sure it has your localhost uri as value or just set it to `*`.
